# Internet Basics
There are basically 3 different types of Files that make up the Internet:  
1. HTML  
 HTML stands for _HyperText Markup Language_. It is not a programming language
 and therefor does not support any logic like if-else statements or loops. HTML solely
 defines the __content__ of a website and its position and style in regards to other 
 content of website.  
  
2. CSS  
 CSS stands for _Cascading StyleSheets_ and it defines the style of the different 
 html elements.
## Internet 
A great resource for learning HTML is [W3 School HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
