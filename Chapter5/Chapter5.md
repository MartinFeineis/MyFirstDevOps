## openssh
To connect to the _Terminal_ of a Linux computer we can use the `ssh` program. The syntax is like
`ssh <username>@<Ip-Address/Hostname>`. An important part of using ssh 
is _authentication_ this can happen in two ways. 

### 1. Password authentication
Here the command is run like above for example `ssh johnd@192.168.1.72` or 
`ssh johnd@www.myfristserver.com`. This way the terminal ask for a password 
after establishing the connection. See example below:
```
ssh johnd@192.168.1.72
password:
```
Note that the typed password will not appear and neither will stars or any other 
symbols. This also prevents that the length of the password can't be guessed 
by watching the screen
