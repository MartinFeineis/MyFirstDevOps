## Goals of this course
The intention of this course is to get a high level understanding of the current practices
in most modern IT Projects. This course should give a guidance how to focus your 
own learning and possible career pathes in the IT landscape. This course is not meant to 
teach you _everything_. This course is meant to guide you through your own learning path.
You could ask know, why you need to be here in the first place? I want to help guide people
on meaningful and successful learning pathes through IT. I tried to teach myself to 
get into IT and become a developer for 15 years. I read a lot of books, a lot of 
which I didn't understand at the time of reading.

We will cover how the internet works with IP Addresses and 
DNS resolution. We will learn basic 3-Tier Architecture, and understand Frontend, 
Backend and Data Layer concepts and Technologies.
